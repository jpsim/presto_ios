# Presto for iOS

Unofficial [Presto](http://prestocard.ca) iOS app. Pretty unexciting right now. Currently only shows the current balance on a Presto card. Works with both registered and unregistered cards.

Soon, this will allow you to:

* receive push notifications when your card's balance changes
* load your card
